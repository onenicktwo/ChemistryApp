# ChemistryApp
A program I made during Highschool in a response to a topic I was learning in Chemistry.
The program does work, however it does suffer from a couple issues:
1. Slow, It has a O(n^2) time complexity, due to just using for loops
2. Messy, I believe this was my second big project I made in the language
